This program should ouput (on a POSIX system):
	Hi there (and now a ls):
	<list of files in current directory, as ls outputs it>

	Retval (should be 0): 0
	Will run: exit 2

	Retval (should be 2): 2
	GOOD: = pushed -2 on zero length string.
There should be no indention in the output. (It was done here for clarity.)
The blank lines should match.

The last test (value on zero length string) is implementation defined, but
cfunge is supposed to push -2. Other implementations may push other values
(even 0).
