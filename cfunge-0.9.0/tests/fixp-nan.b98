What correct behaviour is here I don't know. The fingerprint is underspecified.
Common behaviours (in all cases same for both of the tests) include:
 cfunge (32 bit cells) and RC/Funge-98 pushes -2147483648.
 cfunge (64 bit cells) pushes -9223372036854775808.
 efunge and CCBI pushes 0.
 PyFunge reflects.
By the way: -2147483648 seems to be NaN (as represented in "long double" on
x86/x86_64) cast to 32-bit signed integer.
