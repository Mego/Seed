Thanks to
---------

Alex Smith (maintainer of C-INTERCAL)...
  ...for finding several bugs in cfunge.
  ...for writing the C-INTERCAL/Befunge FFI.

Matti Niemenmaa...
  ...for being the author of the excellent Befunge test suite Mycology.
  ...for writing the Befunge interpreter CCBI which was very helpful to study
     when writing cfunge.


Third party code
----------------

Some of the code has been inspired by how the Befunge interpreter CCBI
(coded in D) solves certain issues:
  CCBI was written by Matti Niemenmaa.
  See http://iki.fi/matti.niemenmaa/befunge/ccbi.html for more information.

Some code have been taken from other projects (all in lib/*).
They have been modified as needed to work in the cfunge project.

Some whole libraries were imported:

  Genx, A library for writing XML files.
    By: Tim Bray.
    URL: http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/genx/
    lib/genx/*

  libghthash, A generic hash library.
    By: Simon Kagstrom
    URL: http://www.ipd.bth.se/ska/sim_home/libghthash.html
    lib/libghthash/*

Just a few files were taken from:

  CrossFire, A Multiplayer game for X-windows:
    By: Crossfire Development Team
    URL: http://crossfire.real-time.com/
    lib/stringbuffer/*
      Some string buffer routines to make constructing strings by appending
      easier.
