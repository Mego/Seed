This file details current status of the Befunge93/98/109 interpreter cfunge.

Before next release
-------------------
 * Test
   * For i: Check that binary mode works.
 * Free if too large gap and test the IP code after the change to avoid
   realloc() every time.

Future
------
 * Several more fingerprints
 * Better hash library.
 * Rewrite TURT to use events, to handle lines on top of dots.
 * Handle Funge-109 fingerprint URIs.

Ideas for future
----------------
 * Make trace interface better, possibly make it interface with some sort of
   debugger (like the one of CCBI but better).
