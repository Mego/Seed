Note that these examples mostly come from other sources. I have not written
most of them myself.

Those that are known:
 * From http://catseye.tc/projects/befunge93/eg/INDEX.html :
   * dladv.bf   Simple (or rather minimal!) adventure game in Befunge93.
   * life.bf    Game of life in Befunge93.
   * pi2.bf     Generate first 100 digits of Pi.
   * prime.bf   Print all prime numbers up to 254.
   * robot.b93  A simple game in Befunge93. Note this one does NOT work in
                Befunge98 mode due to space in string issues.
                Run with -s 93 option to cfunge.
   * wumpus.bf  Hunt the wumpus in Befunge93
 * My own ones (all GPL3 with proxy like the main code):
   * hello-concurrent1.b98
     Use two threads to print hello world, uses several "mutexes" to lock.
     For this example to work the interpreter must be compiled with concurrency.
   * hello-concurrent2.b98
     A lock free version of the above.
     For this example to work the interpreter must be compiled with concurrency.
   * roman.b98
     This shows an example of how to use fingerprints. Also valid in unefunge98.
   * count.b98
     This one just asks for a number to be input, then prints all numbers from
     1 up to (and including) that number. The number entered should be positive.
Unknown ones:
   * fib.bf
     Calculate the n-th element in the Fibonacci sequence.
   * hello.bf
     Standard Hello world, done in the most simple way possible.
