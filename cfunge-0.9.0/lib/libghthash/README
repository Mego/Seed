This directory contains part of libghthash-0.6.2 from
http://www.ipd.bth.se/ska/sim_home/libghthash.html
Only the parts cfunge use are included. See website for more information on the
library.

It has been changed to:
 * Use Boehm-GC.
 * Use C99 stuff when possible.
 * Not be generic, but use the exact data types we handle.
 * Hard code stuff in to avoid function pointers.
 * Possibly some other stuff.
